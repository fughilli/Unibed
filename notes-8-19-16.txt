Python program that takes python AST and converts it into template configs in
C++

Use that template config to compile a C++ program using those templates
Develop other template assembler frontends (graphical?)

graphical becomes LEGO? physical programming (assemble LEGOs to write program,
use Kinect and SLAM to derive a 3D representation; fit grid and compute layout;
construct program; compile)
