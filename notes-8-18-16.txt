Rabbit cipher (or other stream cipher) adapter
Multiplexer adapter that allows specifying fast branch (StreamSetupAdapter --
could be used to direct traffic to a KExAdapter for initial key exchange during
connection setup, after which the StreamSetupAdapter will be flipped over to
the other branch, which is marked likely (so the instructions will be generated
to maximize cache hits with the likely branch on an address subsequent to PC);
maximize runtime performance!!!)
